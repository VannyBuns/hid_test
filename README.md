# HID-TEST
This application is a small tool to view the data that comes from HID devices. It has been ported to Aroma.

# How to use

Simply start this from the Wii U Menu  and attach a HID device.
The app should show you the vid, pid and the incoming data.  
Read the [controller patcher wiki](https://github.com/Maschell/controller_patcher/wiki/) for more information about creating config files for controller_patcher applications.

# Building
In order to build this application, you need the latest release of [wut](https://github.com/devkitPro/wut), and then run the Makefile of HID-TEST.
